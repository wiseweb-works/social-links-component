## About The Project

The "Social Links Profile" challenge is a great exercise for beginners to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills. The goal is to create a personalized link-sharing profile that displays all your social media links in a clean, responsive design. This component does not use JavaScript, making it an excellent way to focus on core web development skills.

Your users should be able to:

- View an organized and responsive list of social links.
- Navigate to your social profiles with a single click.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design principles
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I learned

This project provided an opportunity to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills. I focused on creating a clean and responsive layout using Flexbox. Understanding how to structure semantic HTML and apply responsive design techniques was a key takeaway.

## Useful resources

1. [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - A go-to resource for HTML and CSS references.
2. [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped in understanding and applying Flexbox properties effectively.
